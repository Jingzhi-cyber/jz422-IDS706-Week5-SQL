This repository sets up an environment on CodeSpaces and uses GitHub Actions to run a Makefile for the following commands: make install, make test, make format, and make lint.

## Getting Started
To set up the project, simply run make all or run make install and make test.

## Project Structure
- **.devcontainer** includes a Dockerfile and devcontainer.json. The **Dockerfile** within this folder specifies how the container should be built, and other settings in this directory may control development environment configurations.
- **workflows** includes GitHub Actions, which contain configuration files for setting up automated build, test, and deployment pipelines for your project.
- **.gitignore** is used to specify which files or directories should be excluded from version control when using Git.
- **Makefile** is a configuration file used in Unix-based systems for automating tasks and building software. It contains instructions and dependencies for compiling code, running tests, and other development tasks.
- **README.md** is the instruction file for the readers.
- **requirements.txt** is to specify the dependencies (libraries and packages) required to run the project.
- **test_main.py** is a test file for main.py that can successfully run in IDEs.
- **main.py** is a Python file that contains the main function.
